👋 Hi, I’m Steven Spreizer [@stevespreiz](https://github.com/stevespreiz)

🎓 I'm a master's student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in the Scientific Computation Research Center (SCOREC)

💻 I'm interested in scientific computation, specifically computational fluid dynamics. I've worked on projects involving CFD, finite elements, Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), finite differences, and particle-in-cell methods

🏫 I also have studied machine learning and am looking to get involved in projects in ML which can relate to the engineering applications I enjoy

🔗 You can learn more about me on my [GitHub Pages site](stevespreiz@github.io)
